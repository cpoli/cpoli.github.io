About
=====

This is the primary site for the distribution of the python package **chain_tb**, from Charles Poli at Lancaster University.

Motivations
-----------

The **chain_tb** package models a one-dimensional tight-binding dimer chain with real and/or complex valued hoppings and onsite energies. Defects in the dimer chain can be introduced by locally modifying the on-site energies and/or the hoppings or, by changing the dimerization pattern i.e. switching the intradimer hopping with the interdimer hopping. In the case of zero onsite energies, the model can reproduce the Shockley [Sho39]_ and SSH [Su79]_ states. Note that these systems  acquired recently a renewed interest considering complex onsites energies allowing to amplify the topologically protected midgap state [Sch13]_,  [Pol15]_.

This package can then by useful to illustrate the concepts of:

    * Parity-Time symmetry and and Parity-Time symmetry breaking.

    * sublattice symmetry breaking (for an odd number of sites), resulting in a mode of zero energy.

    * localized states introduced by dimerization defects in the dimerization pattern.

    * topologically protected states:

        * localized in one edge of dimer chain with alternating couplings and sublattice symmetry breaking, the Shokley state.

        * localized at the dimerization defect in a dimer chain with with alternating couplings and sublattice symmetry breaking, the so-called SSH model.


The chain is defined by:

* a unit cell composed of two sites labeled A and B:

    :height: 220px
    :width:  120px
    :align: center

.. note::

    The chain starts with a A site.

* two hoppings (with non zeros real parts), the intradimer coupling :math:`t_{ab}=t_a` which links the A sites to the B sites, and the interdimer hopping :math:`t_{ba} =t_b` which links the B sites to the A sites.

* two onsite energies :math:`\epsilon_{a}` for the A sites, and :math:`\epsilon_{b}` for the B sites.

* For an even number of sites :math:`n=2m` the chain is composed of :math:`m` unit cells.

    For :math:`n=10`:

    .. image:: ../figs/n10_ta(1+0j)_tb(1+0j)_ea0,5j_eb-0,5j/lattice.png
        :height: 100px
        :width:  95%
        :align: center


* For an odd number of sites :math:`2n+1` the chain is composed of :math:`n` unit cells plus an extra A site.

    For :math:`n=11`:

    .. image:: ../figs/n11_ta(1+0j)_tb(1+0j)_ea0,5j_eb-0,5j/lattice.png
        :height: 100px
        :width:  95%
        :align: center

The defects implemented in the **chain_tb** package can:

    * change locally the onsite energies

    * change locally the hoppings

    * introduce a defect in the dimerization pattern


The **chain_tb** package can:

    * obtain the spectrum (eigenenergies of the tight-binding Hamiltonian) and the probability densities of the states of the system (absolute value squared eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian).

    * obtain the polarization of the A sublattice (the sum of the probability densities of the A sites)

    * select states by introducing a condition on the A sublattice polarization (revealing zero modes and/or localized states).

    * test the robustness to disorder by implementing hopping disorder.

    * get the time evolution of the field (using the Crank-Nicolson method).

    * get the time evolution of the field with adiabatic pumping (smooth variation of the hoppings).
